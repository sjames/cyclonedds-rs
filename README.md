# cyclonedds-rs 

Rust bindings for cyclonedds https://github.com/eclipse-cyclonedds/cyclonedds.
This crate no longer depends on a code generator. The Cyclone serialization
interface is used to implement the Rust interface. You can annotate a structure
with the new derive macro and start subscribing and publishing right from Rust.

# Introduction

This crate allows you to use the cyclonedds library using safe Rust. It uses the
cyclone serialization/deserialization interface for high performance and IDL free usage.

# Features

1. Qos
2. Reader and Writer
3. Listener with closure callbacks
4. Async reader 
5. multiple and nested keys

# Roadmap Features
1. Shared memory support using iceoryx

# Examples
